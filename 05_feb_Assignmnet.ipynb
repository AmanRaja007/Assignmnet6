    "The Default __init__ Constructor in Python. Constructors are used to initializing the objectâ€™s state. The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created. Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at the time of Object creation. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object."
